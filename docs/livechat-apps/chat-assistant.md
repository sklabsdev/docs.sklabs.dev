## Tokens

In this AI-powered LiveChat support app, OpenAI is used to provide features such as text expansion, personalized message tone, grammar correction, real-time assistance, and customizable keyboard shortcuts. This is achieved through tokenization, which is the process of breaking down input text into smaller units, called tokens, that the AI model can understand and generate text based on. These tokens are then processed by the model to generate meaningful responses, making the LiveChat support more efficient and effective.

You can think of tokens as pieces of words, where 1,000 tokens is about 750 words.

## Pricing

The app is free to use, and with the initial installation, you will receive 5k tokens. Chat inputs vary in length, so it's hard to calculate the average usage for your account. However, that amount of tokens should give you and your team a nice overview of the app.

When your tokens will expire, you can top-up your account using In-App Upgrades from the Settings section. We will also send you an email reminding you that your tokens are about to expire.
