## Main GitHub repository

You have to choose your **main GitHub repository** from the select box. You will be able to search, view and create new issues within this repository.

## Searching issues

You can search for issues that already exist on your **main GitHub repository**. To do that, start typing the search phrase.
For each issue, the app displays the issue title, its creation date, as well as the status.

## Viewing attached issues

As an agent, you have access to the issues assigned to a customer account. You can find them in the **Attached issue** section. View them in the Agent Application or open them in **main GitHub repository** with just one click.
